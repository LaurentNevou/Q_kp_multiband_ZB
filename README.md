# Q_kp_multiband_ZB
Computes the electronic band structure of bulk ZB semiconductor with various k.p models.

A database of the most common semiconductor II-V and II-VI is provided and can be adjusted.

Various models are available:

-> k.p 3 bands

-> k.p 4 bands

-> k.p 6 bands

-> k.p 8 bands (Kane)

-> k.p 8 bands (Luttinger)

-> k.p 14 bands

-> k.p 16 bands
